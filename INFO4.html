      <p>Earthquakes are the shaking, rolling or sudden shock of the earth’s surface. Earthquakes happen along cracks (called fault lines) in the earth’s surface. Earthquakes can be felt over large areas, although they usually last less than one minute. Earthquakes cannot be predicted although scientists are working on it.</p>

In extreme heat and high humidity (which is when the air has moisture and feels sticky), the body must work extra hard to maintain a normal temperature and keep the body comfortable. A heat wave is an extended period of extreme heat, and there is often high humidity. These conditions can be dangerous for people who don’t take care of themselves properly.</p>

      <p>Hurricanes are severe tropical storms that form in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of
Mexico, and in the eastern Pacific Ocean. They gather heat and energy through contact with warm ocean
waters. Evaporation from the seawater increases their power. Hurricanes rotate in a counter-clockwise
direction around an “eye.” Hurricanes have winds at least 74 miles per hour. When hurricanes come onto
land, their heavy rain, strong winds, and large waves can damage buildings, trees, and cars.</p>

in the ground, during heavy rainfall or rapid snowmelt and changes the earth into a flowing river of mud
or “slurry.” They can occur quickly, striking fast with little or no warning. They also can travel several miles
from their source, growing in size as they pick up trees, boulders, cars, and other materials.</p>

    <div class="tl-content">
      <p>A tsunami (pronounced soo-nahm-ee) is a series of giant waves that happen after underwater movement due to a variety of natural events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and meteorites. The waves travel in all directions from the area of disturbance, much like the ripples that happen after throwing a rock. The waves may travel in the open sea as fast as 450 miles per hour. As the big waves approach shallow waters along the coast they grow to a great height and smash into the shore. They can be as high as 100 feet. They can cause a lot of destruction on the shore. “Tsunami” is a Japanese word. Tsu means “harbor” and nami means “wave.”</p>

    </div>

    <div class="tl-content">
     <p>A volcano is a mountain that opens downward to a pool of molten, or melted, rock below the surface of the Earth.
Unlike most mountains, which are pushed up from below, volcanoes are vents through which molten rock escapes to
the Earth’s surface. When pressure from gases within the molten rock becomes too great, an eruption occurs. Eruptions
can be quiet or explosive. There may be lava flows, flattened landscapes, poisonous gases, and flying rock and ash that
can sometimes travel hundreds of miles downwind. Because of their intense heat, lava flows are great fire hazards.
Lava flows destroy everything in their path but most move slowly enough that people can move out of the way.</p>

    <div class="tl-content">
      <p>A wildfire is a fire that rages out of control in the wilderness, like a forest or countryside. Wildfires often begin unnoticed. These fires are usually triggered by lightning or accidents, such as campers or hikers that did not take care of their campfire properly. They spread quickly, igniting brush, trees, and homes.</p>

      <li>If you don’t have a smoke alarm, check with your local fire department about getting a free one.</li>
      <li>Help your parents to rake the lawn and rid it of leaves and twigs. These can catch fire if a wildfire is near your home.</li>

      <li>Help your parents place important papers and family photographs inside the car, inside the garage. Put your pets in the car, too, so if you need to leave immediately, everything is packed.</li>
      <li>Put important things that won’t be damaged by water in a pool or pond.</li>

    </div>

    <div class="tl-content">
     <p>Winter storms can range from a normal snow over a few hours to a blizzard with blinding, wind-driven snow
that lasts for several days. Many winter storms bring dangerously low temperatures and sometimes, strong
winds, icing, sleet, and freezing rain. One of the main concerns is that winter weather can knock out heat,
power, and communication, sometimes for days at a time. Heavy snowfall and extreme cold can have serious
effects on an entire region. Icy roadways can cause serious accidents, and sometimes people die from being in
really cold temperatures for too long.</p>
